                How to Gain Muscle, No Matter Who You Are
              </h1>
            </header>
            <p>
              When it comes to physique improvements, muscle building is often a
              top priority.
              <br />
              <br />
              Added muscle mass will increase the definition of your muscles,
              improve your lean body mass, and add bulk and size to your frame
              in all the right places.
              <br />
              <br />
              Muscle growth takes time, persistence, and a long-term commitment
              to the process. <br />
              <br />
              While gaining large amounts of muscle may seem daunting, with
              proper training programs and adequate consumption of certain
              foods, serious muscle building is possible for most people. <br />
              <br />
              This article breaks down everything you need to know when it comes
              to building muscle, including how to work out, what to eat, and
              recovery protocols.

              The basics of building muscle
            </h2>
            <p>
              Your body is in a constant process of renewing and recycling the
              amino acids, or protein building blocks, in your muscles.
              <br />
              <br />
              If your body removes more protein than it adds, you’ll lose muscle
              mass. If the net protein synthesis is even, no measurable change
              in muscle size occurs. Finally, if your body deposits more protein
              than it removes, your muscles will grow.
              <br />
              <br />
              The key to building muscle is to increase the rate of protein
              deposition while minimizing the rate of protein breakdown.
              <br />
              <br />
              This process of increasing your muscle mass is known as muscle
              hypertrophy, and it’s a primary goal of resistance training.
              <br />
              <br />
              The muscle building process is driven by several factors,
              including hormones like testosterone and growth hormone, as well
              as the availability of amino acids and other nutrients.
              <br />

              Tips for how to gain muscle
            </h2>
            <p>
              While many types of exercise offer health benefits, the only way
              to reliably drive muscle growth is by using your muscles against
              moderate to heavy resistance. In addition, muscle growth is
              specific to the muscles being used.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              <h2 className="mb-4 text-1xl font-extrabold leading-tight text-gray-900 lg:mb-6 lg:text-4xl dark:text-white">
                1. Decide your target number of repetitions
              </h2>
              Stimulating muscle growth requires performing weight training
              exercises with an amount of weight that only allows you to perform
              1–20 repetitions.
              <br />
              <br />
              In general, the repetition continuum states that weights you can
              only lift for a few repetitions tend to build more strength,
              weights you can lift for 6–12 repetitions tend to build more
              muscle, and weights you can lift for 12–20 repetitions tend to
              increase muscular endurance.
              <br />
              <br />
              1–5 reps: develops more strength
              <br />
              <br />
              6–12 reps: develops more muscle growth
              <br />
              <br />
              12–20 reps: develops more muscular endurance
              <br />
              <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              To put it simply, depending on who you are, your muscles may grow
              more with lower reps using heavy weights, or with high reps using
              lighter weights.
              <br />
              <br />
            </p>
            <h2 className="mb-4 text-1xl font-extrabold leading-tight text-gray-900 lg:mb-6 lg:text-4xl dark:text-white">
              2. Choose the right amount of weight
            </h2>
            <p>
              The weight you choose to use should leave you at or near failure
              on your specified number of repetitions.
              <br />
              <br />
              For example, if you’re performing a set of 10 repetitions, by the
              tenth repetition, you should be unable or nearly unable to perform
              another repetition. You should rarely have more than “two reps in
              the tank” by the end of a set if your goal is building muscle.
              <br />
              <br />
              The overall implication of the repetition range continuum is that
              you should go through different phases of training using different
              repetition ranges to see what gives your body the most muscle
              growth.
              <br />
              <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              <h2 className="mb-4 text-1xl font-extrabold leading-tight text-gray-900 lg:mb-6 lg:text-4xl dark:text-white">
                3. Choose your exercises well
              </h2>
              As mentioned, muscle building is specific to the muscle being
              worked.
              <br />
              <br />
              For example, to build bigger biceps, you need to perform exercises
              that work the biceps. This could be an isolated bicep exercise,
              such as a bicep curl, or a compound movement that uses the biceps,
              such as a pullup.
              <br />
              <br />
              In terms of the best exercise type for muscle building, compound
              and isolation movements can be equally effective at causing muscle
              hypertrophy (4Trusted Source).
              <br />
              <br />
              Nevertheless, for the best long-term fitness results, you should
              include both compound and isolation movements in your training.
              <br />
              <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              <h2 className="mb-4 text-1xl font-extrabold leading-tight text-gray-900 lg:mb-6 lg:text-4xl dark:text-white">
                4. Structure your workout to avoid overtraining
              </h2>
              A good rule of thumb is to perform 3 sets of 3–5 compound
              movements, followed by 3 sets of 1–2 isolation movements per
              workout.
              <br />
              <br />
              Generally, you do your heaviest sets using compound movements and
              perform higher repetition ranges on your isolation movements.
              <br />
              <br />
              Assuming you’re performing three working sets per exercise, limit
              your total combined compound and isolation movement exercises to
              5–7 movements per workout.
              <br />
              <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              <h2 className="mb-4 text-1xl font-extrabold leading-tight text-gray-900 lg:mb-6 lg:text-4xl dark:text-white">
                The bottom line
              </h2>
              Gaining muscle requires a commitment to both resistance training
              and following an appropriate diet.
              <br />
              <br />
              Workout programs for building muscle should primarily rely on
              compound and isolation movements with weights, but adjust the
              specific exercises, sets, and repetitions to ensure consistent,
              long-term gains in both muscle size and strength.
              <br />
              <br />
              Proper nutrition involves sufficient protein, fat, and calorie
              intakes that exceed your daily energy expenditure enough to build
              muscle, but not so drastically as to cause excess fat gain.
              <br />
              <br />
              Large increases in muscle mass take months to years of consistent
              training but are possible for most individuals.
              <br />
              <br />
              Overall, to reach your muscle building goals, you must lift hard,
              eat right, and stay consistent.
